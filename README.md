# AWS-EKS-Deployment

- This is a full fledged Wordpress website launched on EKS which includes load balancer which can even manage all the traffic coming on its ways and can launch pods automatically on AMAZON AWS.

### Do you know what's EKS?
&#9745; Amazon EKS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

&#x2611; AWS makes it easy to run Kubernetes. You can choose to manage Kubernetes infrastructure yourself with Amazon EC2 or get an automatically provisioned, managed Kubernetes control plane with Amazon EKS. Either way, you get powerful, community-backed integrations to AWS services like VPC, IAM, and service discovery as well as the security, scalability, and high-availability of AWS.
